Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project CodeBook


This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was have completed to clean up the datasets.
•	The site where the data was obtained:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
•	The run_analysis.R script performs the following steps to clean the data:

1.	Read the following files in the “./data” folder and then store with new variable names listed:
	X_train.txt (store as:  trainDatapoints )
	y_train.txt (store as:  trainLabels )
	subject_train.txt ( store as: trainSubjects)
	X_test.txt (store as:  testDatapoints )
	y_test.txt (store as:  testLabels )
	subject_test.txt (store as: testSubjects)
2.	Concatenate the following stored data sets to create 3 unique, joined 10299x561 data sets:
	testDatapoints to trainDatapoints called joinedDatapoints
	testLabels to trainLabels  called joinedLabels
	testSubjects to trainSubjects  called joinedSubjects
3.	Read the features.txt file from the "/data" folder and store the data in a variable called features. The requirement is to only extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation. This results in a 66 indices list. This results in a subset of called joinedDatacalc with the 66 corresponding columns.
4.	Clean the column names of the subset. 
	Removed the "()" and "-" symbols in the names
	Make the first letter of a capital letter "mean" and "std" , resulting in names “Mean” and “Std”. 
5.	Read the activity_labels.txt file from the "./data"" folder and store the data in a variable called activitydata.
6.	Clean the activity names in the second column of activitydata. 
	Make all names to lower cases. 
	If the name has an underscore between letters, remove the underscore and capitalize the letter immediately after the underscore.
7.	Transform the values of joinedLabels according to the activitydatalabels data frame.
8.	Combine the joinedSubjects, joinedLabels and joinedDatapoints by column resulting in a new, clean 10299x68 data frame called cleanData
9.	 Properly name the first two columns, "subject" and "activity". The "subject" column contains integers that range from 1 to 30 inclusive; the "activity" column contains 6 kinds of activity names; the last 66 columns contain measurements that range from -1 to 1 exclusive.
10.	Write the cleanData out to " cleanmergeddata.txt" file in current working directory.
11.	Generate a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject. There are 30 unique subjects and 6 unique activities, which result in a 180 combinations of the two. Then, for each combination, calculate the mean of each measurement with the corresponding combination. So, after initializing the finalresult data frame and performing the two for-loops, we get a 180x68 data frame.
12.	Write the finalresult out to " finalsetwithmeans..txt" file in current working directory.
